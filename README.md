# Iridian-app

English:

This is my test for Iridian.

Basically, I think I have met all the minimum expectations that the test asks for the front-end developer.

I only have two observations, when you click on a bet, it will be reflected in the "My bets" option instantly and in other occasions you will have to click more than once, according to what I could investigate and deduce is that this is due to the response time of the api and is not something that the developer can control. (However I am still looking for a solution, if possible).

When accessing the "My bets" option the buttons are still accessible.
When a bet is repeated (same ID) and one is removed, all bets with the same ID will be removed, because there is no differentiator.
